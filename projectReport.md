## 1. Executive Summary  

### Overview  
- Multiplayer Pong game developed using **Raylib** and **ENet** in C++.  
- Focus on real-time gameplay mechanics, OOP principles (encapsulation, modularity), and network synchronization.  

### Key Findings  
- Achieved smooth synchronization using custom aspect ratio handling.  
- Implemented themes, GUI, and robust networking logic.  

---

## 2. Introduction  

### Background  
- Practical implementation of OOP concepts in a classic game with multiplayer capabilities.  

### Project Objectives  
- Develop a feature-rich multiplayer Pong game using **Raylib** (graphics) and **ENet** (networking).  

---

## 3. Project Description  

### Scope  
- **Included**: Online multiplayer, theme switching, GUI menu, ball/paddle sync, basic physics.  
- **Excluded**: Advanced AI, matchmaking systems.  

### Technical Overview  
- **Tools**: Visual Studio Code with GCC.  
- **Tech Stack**: Raylib (graphics), ENet (networking).  
- **Assets**: Organized into theme-specific folders (e.g., `underwater/`, `fireAndIce/`).

## 4. Methodology  

### Approach  
- **Planned Development**:  
  - 14 days dedicated to learning ENet.  
  - 10 days for networking implementation.  
  - Modular development with weekly milestones.  

### Roles and Responsibilities  
- **Shamveel**: Networking, game logic, ball sync.  
- **Muzamil**: GUI and menu implementation.  
- **Kabeer**: Theme and asset management.

## 5. Project Implementation  

### Design and Structure  
- Modular architecture with clear separation of responsibilities.  

### Functionalities Developed  
- Multiplayer support via ENet.  
- Ball/paddle synchronization across resolutions.  
- Theme selection GUI.  

### Challenges Faced  
- **ENet Setup**: Limited community support.  
- **Sync Issues**: Developed a method to send normalized coordinates instead of screen sizes.  
- **Interpolation**: Learned to smooth movement between network updates.

## 6. Results  

### Project Outcomes  
- Fully functional multiplayer game with theme support and OOP adherence.  

### Screenshots and Illustrations  
- Included in supplementary submission.  

### Testing and Validation  
- Tested across resolutions and network conditions for reliable sync and responsiveness.

## 7. Conclusion  

### Summary of Findings  
- Successfully built a real-time multiplayer game with Raylib/ENet.  
- Gained expertise in networking, interpolation, and game design.  

### Final Remarks  
- Enhanced understanding of OOP and networked game development.
